# Gideon Replay

Gideon replay is a publicly freely available library that can be integrated into any web application with just a few lines of code to record and replay user interactions such as mouse clicks and keystrokes. Replay can be controlled via a web player interface. This interface shows activity types and idle times as well as an attention heat map. In addition, we enable the export of all interactions for a later analysis. In summary, Gideon provides free, easy tracking of user interactions and significantly reduces the effort required for specified and customized tracking solutions.
