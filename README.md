# gideon (Guided Exploration)

Gideon is a framework to record provenance and analyse recurring interaction pattern in web-based applications. Gideon allows to record a non-linear interaction graph that represents the history of interactions performed by a user while using an application.

Gideon consists of a frontend library to implement interaction recording in a web-based frontend and a backend service to store interactions and perform graph-algorithms on the recorded data.
